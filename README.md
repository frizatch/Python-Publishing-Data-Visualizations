Using the right data visualization libraries for creating your figures - tips and tricks


Matplotlib

You can see the [common plot types](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html) available for matplotlib. The [gallery page](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html) for matplotlib has many examples of full figures with available source codes for their creation.

Note that pandas.DataFrame.plot is a convenient wrapper around Matplotlib to create simple plots.
